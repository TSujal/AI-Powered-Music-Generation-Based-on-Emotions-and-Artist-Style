# AI-Powered Music Generation Using Emotion and Artist Style

Project Description: This project leverages artificial intelligence techniques to generate personalized music based on user preferences, specifically incorporating emotional content and artist style. The aim is to bridge the gap in the market where users struggle to find personalized songs. By creating a diverse dataset of songs from Hindi/Bollywood and English artists, this project enables the generation of new music that captures the unique emotional and stylistic elements of the selected artists.

### Key Features:

* Dataset Collection: A collection of songs from popular Hindi/Bollywood and English artists, totaling nearly 840 songs.

* Emotion Extraction: Extraction of emotional content from song lyrics and metadata.

* Feature Extraction: Conversion of audio files into numerical formats for model training.

* Music Generation: Implementation of AI models to generate new music that aligns with the emotional content and stylistic preferences of the chosen artists.

Motivation: The primary motivation behind this project stems from a passion for Artificial Intelligence and a desire to fill the market gap where users struggle to find personalized music. By creating a dataset of songs 
from both Hindi/Bollywood and English artists, I aimed to provide users with a diverse listening experience that can be tailored to their emotional and stylistic preferences.

### Components of the Project:

1. Data Collection and Conversion: Collecting songs from YouTube and converting them into MP3 format.
2. Emotion Extraction: Extracting emotions from song lyrics using Wikipedia and manually feeding emotions for certain songs.
3. Feature Extraction: Converting audio files to numerical formats.
4. Model Evaluation and Music Generation: Using AI models to generate new music based on the extracted features and emotions.

### Technical Setup:

* Dataset: 400 Hindi/Bollywood songs and 440 English songs.
* Computing Environment: Run on a local machine using Python and required libraries (e.g., librosa, scikit-learn, tensorflow, pandas).
* GitHub Files:
   * data_collection_conversion.ipynb: Collects and converts songs into MP3 format.
   * emotion_extraction.ipynb: Extracts emotions from song lyrics.
   * feature_extraction.ipynb: Converts MP3 files to numeric format.
   * model_evaluation_and_music_generation.ipynb: Implements models to generate new music.
